# Controllers  
  Controllers are used to determine the type of high-level control over a given robot arm. While all arms are directly controlled via their joint torques, the inputted action space for a given environment can vary depending on the type of desired control. Below, a list of supported controllers and their respective action dimensions are listed.
| Controller Name |   Controller Type			| 			Action Dimension<br>(Gripper Not Included)    |  Format |  
| :-------------: | :-------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :-----: |
| OSC_POSE        |   Operational Space Control (Position + Orientation)   | 6 | (x, y, z, i, j, k)    |  
| OSC_POSITION    |   Operational Space Control (Position Only)            | 3 | (x, y, z)             |  
| IK_POSE         |   Inverse Kinematics Control (Position + Orientation)  | 7 | (x, y, z, i, j, k, w) |
| JOINT_POSITION  |   Joint Position                                                    | n | n robot joints        |  
| JOINT_VELOCITY  |   Joint Velocity                                                    | n | n robot joints        |  
| JOINT_TORQUE    |   Joint Torque                                                      | n | n robot joints        |  

When using any position-based control (OSC, IK, or Joint-Position controllers), inputted actions are, by default,
interpreted as delta values from the current state.

Rotations using the IK controller are interpreted as delta rotations from the current end effector orientation in the
form of quaternions (i,j,k,w). Note that the rotation axes are taken relative to the end effector origin, NOT the global
world coordinate frame!

Rotations using the OSC (Pose) controller are interpreted as delta rotations from the current end effector orientation
in the form of exponential coordinates (i,j,k) -- that is, a three-dimensional vector that compresses axis-angle form
into angle * axis. Note that the rotation axes are taken relative to the global world coordinate frame.

## Configurations
The [config directory](config) provides a set of default configuration files that hold default examples of parameters relevant to individual controllers. Note that when creating your controller config templates of a certain type of controller, the listed parameters in the default example are required and should be specified accordingly.

Note: Each robot ([Sawyer](config/default_sawyer.json), [Panda](config/default_panda.json), [Baxter](config/default_baxter.json)) has its own default controller configuration which is called by default unless a [different controller config](#using-a-custom-controller-configuration) is called.

Below, a brief overview and description of each subset of controller parameters are shown:

#### Controller Settings  
* `type`: Type of controller to control. Can be `OSC_POSE`, `OSC_POSITION`, `IK_POSE`, `JOINT_POSITION`, `JOINT_VELOCITY`, or `JOINT_TORQUE`
* `interpolation`: If not `null`, specified type of interpolation to use between desired actions. Currently only `linear` is supported. 
* `{...}_limits`: Limits for that specific controller. E.g.: for a `JOINT_POSITION`, the relevant limits are its joint positions, `qpos_limits` . Can be either a 2-element list (same min/max limits across entire relevant space), or a list of lists (specific limits for each component)
* `ik_{pos, ori}_limit`: Only applicable for IK controller. Limits the magnitude of the desired relative change in position / orientation.
* `{input,output}_{min,max}`: Scaling ranges for mapping action space inputs into controller inputs. Settings these limits will automatically clip the action space input to be within the `input_{min,max}` before mapping the requested value into the specified `output_{min,max}` range. Can be either a scalar (same limits across entire action space), or a list (specific limits for each action component)
* `kp, kv`: Where relevant, specifies the positional / velocity gain for the controller. Can be either be a scalar (same value for all robot joints), or a list (specific values for each joint)
* `damping`: Where relevant, specifies the damping constant for the controller.
* `impedance_mode`: For impedance-based controllers (`OSC_*`, `JOINT_POSITION`), determines the impedance mode for the controller. Can be `fixed`, `variable`, or `variable_kp`.
* `kp_limits, damping_limits`: Only relevant if `impedance_mode` is set to `variable` or `variable_kp`. Sets the limits for the resulting action space for variable impedance gains.
* `control_delta`: Only relevant for `OSC_POSE` or `OSC_POSITION` controllers. `true` interprets input actions as delta values from the current robot end effector position. Otherwise, assumed to be absolute (global) values
* `uncouple_pos_ori`: Only relevant for `OSC_POSE`. `true` decouples the desired position and orientation torques when executing the controller

## Using a Custom Controller Configuration
A custom controller other than the environment defaults (which are normally are `JOINT_VELOCITY` configurations specified for each robot) can be used by simply creating a new config (`.json`) file with the relevant parameters as specified above. All robosuite environments have an optional `controller_config` argument that can be used to pass in specific controller settings. Note that this is expected to be a `dict`, so the new configuration must be read in and parsed as a `dict` before passing it during the environment `robosuite.make(...)` call. A brief example script showing how to import a custom controller configuration is shown below.

```python
import robosuite as suite
from robosuite.controllers import load_controller_config

# Path to config file
controller_fpath = `/your/custom/config/filepath/here/filename.json`

# Import the file as a dict
config = load_controller_config(custom_fpath=controller_fpath)

# Create environment
env = suite.make("PandaLift", controller_config=config, ... )
```

Alternatively, you can load a default controller with the following substitution, where `controller_name` is one of acceptable controller `type` strings:
```python
config = load_controller_config(default_controller=controller_name)
```
