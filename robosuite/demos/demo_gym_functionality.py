"""
This script shows how to adapt an environment to be compatible
with the Gymnasium API. This is useful when using
learning pipelines that require supporting these APIs.

For instance, this can be used with OpenAI Baselines
(https://github.com/openai/baselines) to train agents
with RL.


We base this script off of some code snippets found
in the "Basic Usage" section of the Gymnasium documentation

The following snippet was used to demo basic functionality.

    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make("LunarLander-v2", render_mode="human")
    observation, info = env.reset()

    for _ in range(1000):
        action = env.action_space.sample()  # agent policy that uses the observation and info
        observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
        if terminated or truncated:
            observation, info = env.reset()
            env.close()

To adapt our APIs to be compatible with OpenAI Gym's style, this script
demonstrates how this can be easily achieved by using the GymWrapper.

    # Notice how the environment is wrapped by the wrapper
