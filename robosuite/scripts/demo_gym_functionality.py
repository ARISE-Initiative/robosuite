"""
This script shows how to adapt an environment to be compatible
with the OpenAI gym API. This is extremely useful when using
learning pipelines that require supporting these APIs.

For instance, this can be used with OpenAI Baselines
(https://github.com/openai/baselines) to train agents
with RL.



We base this script off of some code snippets found
in the "Getting Started with Gym" section of the OpenAI 
gym documentation.

The following snippet was used to show how to list all environments.
    from gym import envs
    print(envs.registry.all())

The following snippet was used to demo basic functionality.

    import gym
    env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
    for i_episode in range(20):
        observation = env.reset()
        for t in range(100):
            env.render()
            print(observation)
            action = env.action_space.sample()
            observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
            if done:
                print("Episode finished after {} timesteps".format(t+1))
                break
