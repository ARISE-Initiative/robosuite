This demo script demonstrates the various functionalities of each controller available within robosuite (list of
supported controllers are shown at the bottom of this docstring).

For a given controller, runs through each dimension and executes a perturbation "test_value" from its
neutral (stationary) value for a certain amount of time "steps_per_action", and then returns to all neutral values
for time "steps_per_rest" before proceeding with the next action dim.

    E.g.: Given that the expected action space of the Pos / Ori (EE_POS_ORI) controller (without a gripper) is
    (dx, dy, dz, droll, dpitch, dyaw), the testing sequence of actions over time will be:

        ***START OF DEMO***
        ( dx,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- Translation in x-direction      for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest' steps
        (  0, dy,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- Translation in y-direction      for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest' steps
        (  0,  0, dz,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- Translation in z-direction      for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest' steps
        (  0,  0,  0, dr,  0,  0, grip)     <-- Rotation in roll (x) axis       for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0, dp,  0, grip)     <-- Rotation in pitch (y) axis      for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, dy, grip)     <-- Rotation in yaw (z) axis        for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest' steps
        ***END OF DEMO***

    Thus the EE_POS_ORI controller should be expected to sequentially move linearly in the x direction first,
        then the y direction, then the z direction, and then begin sequentially rotating about its x-axis,
        then y-axis, then z-axis.

Please reference the controller README in the robosuite/controllers directory for an overview of each controller.
Controllers are expected to behave in a generally controlled manner, according to their control space. The expected
sequential qualitative behavior during the test is described below for each controller:

* EE_POS_ORI: Gripper moves sequentially and linearly in x, y, z direction, then sequentially rotates in x-axis, y-axis,
            z-axis, relative to the global coordinate frame
* EE_POS: Gripper moves sequentially and linearly in x, y, z direction, relative to the global coordinate frame
* EE_IK: Gripper moves sequentially and linearly in x, y, z direction, then sequentially rotates in x-axis, y-axis,
            z-axis, relative to the local robot end effector frame
* JOINT_IMP: Robot Joints move sequentially in a controlled fashion
* JOINT_VEL: Robot Joints move sequentially in a controlled fashion
* JOINT_TOR: Unlike other controllers, joint torque controller is expected to act rather lethargic, as the
            "controller" is really just a wrapper for direct torque control of the mujoco actuators. Therefore, a
            "neutral" value of 0 torque will not guarantee a stable robot when it has non-zero velocity!
