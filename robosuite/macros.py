# Image Convention
# Robosuite (Mujoco)-rendered images are based on the OpenGL coordinate frame convention, whereas many downstream
# applications assume an OpenCV coordinate frame convention. For consistency, you can set the image convention
# here; this will assure that any rendered frames will match the associated convention.
# See the figure at the bottom of https://amytabb.com/ts/2019_06_28/ for an informative overview.

# so we skip concatenating all images together by default, unless this flag is set to True
