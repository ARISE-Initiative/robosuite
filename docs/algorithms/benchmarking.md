# Benchmarking

Benchmarking results of standard policy learning algorithms.

## v1.0

We provide a standardized set of benchmarking experiments as baselines for future experiments. Specifically, we test [Soft Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05905), a state of the art model-free RL algorithm, on a select combination of tasks (all), robots (Panda, Sawyer), and controllers (OSC_POSE, JOINT_VELOCITY). Our experiments were implemented and executed in an extended version of [rlkit](https://github.com/vitchyr/rlkit), a popular PyTorch-based RL framework and algorithm library. For ease of replicability, we have released our official benchmarking results on a [separate repository](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite-v1-benchmarking).

All agents were trained for 1500 epochs with 500 steps per episode, and utilize the same standardized algorithm hyperparameters (see our benchmarking repo above for exact parameter values). We normalize the our per-step rewards to 1.0 such that the maximum possible per-episode return is 500. Below, we show the per-task experiments conducted, with each experiment's training curve showing the evaluation return mean's average and standard deviation over three random seeds.

### Block Lifting
For the Block Lifting task, both OSC_POSE and JOINT_VELOCITY were tested on Panda and Sawyer robots.

### Pick Place
For the Pick Place task, single-object simplified variations of the task were used. Specifically, PickPlaceCan and PickPlaceMilk were both tested on Panda and Sawyer robots with OSC_POSE.
