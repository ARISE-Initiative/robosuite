## Version 1.5.0

The 1.5 release of **Robosuite** introduces significant advancements to extend flexibility and realism in robotic simulations. Key highlights include support for diverse robot embodiments (e.g., humanoids), custom robot compositions, composite controllers (such as whole-body controllers), expanded teleoperation devices, and photorealistic rendering capabilities.

### New Features
- **Diverse Robot Embodiments**: Support for complex robots, including humanoids, allowing exploration of advanced manipulation and mobility tasks. Please see [robosuite_models](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite_models) for extra robosuite-compatible robot models.
- **Custom Robot Composition**: Users can now build custom robots from modular components, offering extensive configuration options.
- **Composite Controllers**: New controller abstraction includes whole-body controllers, and the ability to control robots with composed body parts, arms, and grippers.
- **Additional Teleoperation Devices**: Expanded compatibility with teleoperation tools like drag-and-drop in the MuJoCo viewer and Apple Vision Pro.
- **Photorealistic Rendering**: Integration of NVIDIA Isaac Sim for enhanced, real-time photorealistic visuals, bringing simulations closer to real-world fidelity.

### Improvements
- **Updated Documentation**: New tutorials and expanded documentation on utilizing advanced controllers, teleoperation, and rendering options.
- **Simulation speed improvement**: By default we set the `lite_physics` flag to True to skip redundant calls to [`env.sim.step()`](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite/blob/29e73bd41f9bc43ba88bb7d2573b868398905819/robosuite/environments/base.py#L444)

### Migration

- Composite controller refactoring: please see example of [usage](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite/blob/29e73bd41f9bc43ba88bb7d2573b868398905819/robosuite/examples/third_party_controller/mink_controller.py#L421)
