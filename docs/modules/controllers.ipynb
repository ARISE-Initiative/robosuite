    "Controllers are used to determine the type of high-level control over a given robot arm. While all arms are directly controlled via their joint torques, the inputted action space for a given environment can vary depending on the type of desired control. Our controller options include OSC_POSE, OSC_POSITION, JOINT_POSITION, JOINT_VELOCITY and JOINT_TORQUE.\n",
    "\n",
    "For OSC_POSE, OSC_POSITION and JOINT_POSITION, we include three variants that determine the action space. The most common variant is to use a predefine and constant set of impedance parameters; in that case, the action space only includes the desired pose, position or joint configuration. We also include the option to specify either the stiffness values (and the damping will be automatically set to values that lead to critically damped system), or all impedance parameters, both stiffness and damping, as part of the action at each step. These two variants lead to extended action spaces that can control the stiffness and damping behavior of the controller in a variable manner, providing full control to the policy/solution over the contact and dynamic behavior of the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using any position-based control (OSC, IK, or Joint-Position controllers), inputted actions are, by default,\n",
    "interpreted as delta values from the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using any end effector pose controller (IK, OSC_POSE), delta rotations from the current end effector orientation\n",
    "in the form of axis-angle coordinates (ax, ay, az), where the direction represents the axis and the magnitude\n",
    "represents the angle (in radians). Note that for OSC, the rotation axes are taken relative to the global world\n",
    "coordinate frame, whereas for IK, the rotation axes are taken relative to the end effector origin, NOT the global world coordinate frame!\n",

    "## Controllers\n",
    "\n",
    "During run time, the execution of the controllers is as follows. Controllers receive a desired configuration (reference value) and output joint torques that try to minimize the error between the current configuration and the desired one. Policies and solutions provide these desired configurations, elements of some action space, at what we call simulated policy frequency \\\\(f_{p}\\\\), e.g. 20 Hz or 30 Hz. Robosuite will execute several iterations composed of a controller execution and a simulation step at simulation frequency, $f_s$ ($f_s = N\\cdot f_p$), using the same reference signal until a new action is provided by the policy/solution. In these iterations, while the desired configuration is kept constant, the current state of the robot is changing, and thus, the error.\n",

    "In the following we sumarize the options, variables and the control laws (equations) that convert desired values from the policy/solution and current robot states into executable joint torques to minimize the difference.\n",

    "In the OSC_POSE controller, the desired value is the 6D pose (position and orientation) of a controlled frame. We follow the formalism from Oussama Khatib \\[Khatib87\\]. Our control frame is always the \"eef_site\" defined in the [gripper model](../modeling/gripper_model), placed at the end of the last link for robots without gripper or between the fingers for robots with gripper. The operational space control framework (OSC) computes the necessary joint torques to minimize the error between the desired and the current pose of the \"eef_site\" with the minimal kinematic energy. \n",

    "Given a desired pose $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathit{des}}$ and the current end-effector pose, , we first compute the end-effector acceleration that would help minimize the error between both, assumed. PD (proportional-derivative) control schema to improve convergence and stability. For that, we first decompose into a desired position, $p_d \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, and a desired orientation, $R_d \\in \\mathbb{SO}(3)$. The end-effector acceleration to minimize the error should increase with the difference between desired end-effector pose and current pose, $p$ and $R$ (proportional term), and decrease with the current end-effector velocity, $v$ and $\\omega$ (derivative term).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then compute the robot actuations (joint torques) to achieve the desired end-effector space accelerations leveraging the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot with the dynamically-consistent operational space formulation~\\cite{Khatib1995a}. First, we compute the wrenches at the end-effector that correspond to the desired accelerations, ${f}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{6}$.\n",
    "Then, we map the wrenches in end-effector space ${f}$ to joint torque commands with the end-effector Jacobian at the current joint configuration $J=J(q)$: $\\tau = J^T{f}$. \n",

The difference between current and desired position ($\\Delta_p= p_d - p$) and between current and desired orientation ($\\Delta_R = R_d \\ominus R$) can be used as alternative policy action space, $\\mathcal{A}$. $k_p^p$, $k_p^d$, $k_p^R$, and $k_d^R$ are vectors of proportional and derivative gains for position and orientation (parameters $\\kappa$), respectively, set once at initialization and kept fixed.\n",

    "The config directory (found within the [controllers](../source/robosuite.controllers) module) provides a set of default configuration files that hold default examples of parameters relevant to individual controllers.

    "Note: Each robot has its own default controller configuration which is called by default unless a [different controller config](#using-a-custom-controller-configuration) is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, a brief overview and description of each subset of controller parameters are shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Controller Settings  \n",
    "* `type`: Type of controller to control. Can be `OSC_POSE`, `OSC_POSITION`, `IK_POSE`, `JOINT_POSITION`, `JOINT_VELOCITY`, or `JOINT_TORQUE`\n",
    "* `interpolation`: If not `null`, specified type of interpolation to use between desired actions. Currently only `linear` is supported.\n",
    "* `ramp_ratio`: If using `linear` interpolation, specifies the proportion of allotted timesteps (value from [0, 1]) over which to execute the interpolated commands.\n",
    "* `{...}_limits`: Limits for that specific controller. E.g.: for a `JOINT_POSITION`, the relevant limits are its joint positions, `qpos_limits` . Can be either a 2-element list (same min/max limits across entire relevant space), or a list of lists (specific limits for each component)\n",
    "* `ik_{pos, ori}_limit`: Only applicable for IK controller. Limits the magnitude of the desired relative change in position / orientation.\n",
    "* `{input,output}_{min,max}`: Scaling ranges for mapping action space inputs into controller inputs. Settings these limits will automatically clip the action space input to be within the `input_{min,max}` before mapping the requested value into the specified `output_{min,max}` range. Can be either a scalar (same limits across entire action space), or a list (specific limits for each action component)\n",
    "* `kp`: Where relevant, specifies the proportional gain for the controller. Can be either be a scalar (same value for all controller dimensions), or a list (specific values for each dimension)\n",
    "* `damping_ratio`: Where relevant, specifies the damping ratio constant for the controller.\n",
    "* `impedance_mode`: For impedance-based controllers (`OSC_*`, `JOINT_POSITION`), determines the impedance mode for the controller, i.e. the nature of the impedance parameters. It can be `fixed`, `variable`, or `variable_kp` (kd is adjusted to provide critically damped behavior).\n",
    "* `kp_limits, damping_ratio_limits`: Only relevant if `impedance_mode` is set to `variable` or `variable_kp`. Sets the limits for the resulting action space for variable impedance gains.\n",
    "* `control_delta`: Only relevant for `OSC_POSE` or `OSC_POSITION` controllers. `true` interprets input actions as delta values from the current robot end effector position. Otherwise, assumed to be absolute (global) values\n",
    "* `uncouple_pos_ori`: Only relevant for `OSC_POSE`. `true` decouples the desired position and orientation torques when executing the controller\n",

    "## Loading a Controller\n",
    "By default, if no controller configuration is specified during environment creation, then `JOINT_VELOCITY` controllers with robot-specific configurations will be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using a Default Controller Configuration\n",
    "Any controller can be used with its default configuration, and can be easily loaded into a given environment by calling its name as shown below (where `controller_name` is one of acceptable controller `type` strings):\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import robosuite as suite\n",
    "from robosuite import load_controller_config\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the desired controller's default config as a dict\n",
    "config = load_controller_config(default_controller=controller_name)\n",

    "# Create environment\n",
    "env = suite.make(\"Lift\", robots=\"Panda\", controller_config=config, ... )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using a Custom Controller Configuration\n",
    "A custom controller configuration can also be used by simply creating a new config (`.json`) file with the relevant parameters as specified above. All robosuite environments have an optional `controller_config` argument that can be used to pass in specific controller settings. Note that this is expected to be a `dict`, so the new configuration must be read in and parsed as a `dict` before passing it during the environment `robosuite.make(...)` call. A brief example script showing how to import a custom controller configuration is shown below.\n",
