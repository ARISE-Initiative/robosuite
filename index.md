**robosuite** is a simulation framework powered by the [MuJoCo](http://mujoco.org/) physics engine for robot learning. It also offers a suite of benchmark environments for reproducible research.
The current release (v1.5) features diverse robot embodiments (including humanoids), custom robot composition, composite controllers (including whole body controllers), more teleoperation devices and photo-realistic rendering. 
This project is part of the broader [Advancing Robot Intelligence through Simulated Environments (ARISE) Initiative](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative), with the aim of lowering the barriers of entry for cutting-edge research at the intersection of AI and Robotics.
