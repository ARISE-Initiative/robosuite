Test all controllers on the Lift task with Sawyer robot environment as a test case.

The following controllers are tested:
Operational Space Control - Position & Orientation
Operational Space Control - Position only
Inverse Kinematics - Position & Orientation
Joint Impedance
Joint Velocity
Joint Torque

This (non-exhaustive) test script checks for qualitative irregularities in controller behavior.
However, this testing module also checks for action space correctness and dimensionality.
For every controller action space, runs through each dimension and executes a perturbation "test_value" from its
neutral (stationary) value for a certain amount of time "steps_per_action", and then returns to all neutral values
for time "steps_per_rest" before proceeding with the next action dim.

    E.g.: Given that the expected action space of the Pos / Ori (OSC_POSE) controller (without a gripper) is
    (dx, dy, dz, ax, ay, az), the testing sequence of actions over time will be:

        ***START OF TEST***
        ( dx,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- Translation in x-direction      for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest'   steps
        (  0, dy,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- Translation in y-direction      for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest'   steps
        (  0,  0, dz,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- Translation in z-direction      for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest'   steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  a,  0,  0, grip)     <-- Rotation about x axis           for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest'   steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  a,  0, grip)     <-- Rotation about y axis           for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest'   steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  a, grip)     <-- Rotation about z axis           for 'steps_per_action' steps
        (  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, grip)     <-- No movement (pause)             for 'steps_per_rest'   steps
        ***END OF TEST***

    Thus the OSC_POSE controller should be expected to sequentially move linearly in the x direction first,
        then the y direction, then the z direction, and then begin sequentially rotating about its x-axis,
        then y-axis, then z-axis.

Please reference the controller README in the robosuite/controllers directory for an overview of each controller.
Controllers are expected to behave in a generally controlled manner, according to their control space.
    E.g.: the Pos / Ori controller should be expected to move linearly in the x direction first, then the y direction,
        then the z direction, and then begin rotating about its x-axis, then y-axis, then z-axis.

As this is strictly a qualitative set of tests, it is up to the developer / user to examine for specific irregularities.
However, the expected qualitative behavior is described below for each controller:

* OSC_POSE: Gripper moves sequentially and linearly in x, y, z direction, then sequentially rotates in x-axis,
            y-axis, z-axis, relative to the global coordinate frame
* OSC_POSITION: Gripper moves sequentially and linearly in x, y, z direction, relative to the global coordinate frame
* IK_POSE: Gripper moves sequentially and linearly in x, y, z direction, then sequentially rotates in x-axis, y-axis,
            z-axis, relative to the local robot end effector frame
* JOINT_POSITION: Robot Joints move sequentially in a controlled fashion
* JOINT_VELOCITY: Robot Joints move sequentially in a controlled fashion
* JOINT_TORQUE: Unlike other controllers, joint torque controller is expected to act rather lethargic, as the
            "controller" is really just a wrapper for direct torque control of the mujoco actuators. Therefore, a
            "neutral" value of 0 torque will not guarantee a stable robot when it has non-zero velocity!

Note that by default, there is no rendering. Rendering can be enabled by setting the --render flag when calling this
test script.
