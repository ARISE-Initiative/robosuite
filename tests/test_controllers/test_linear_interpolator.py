"""
Test the linear interpolator on the Lift task with Sawyer arm environment as a test case.

The linear interpolator is meant to increase the stability and overall safety of a robot arm's trajectory when reaching
a setpoint, "ramping up" the actual action command sent to a given controller from zero to the actual inputted action
over a fraction of the timesteps in betwteen each high-level input action (the "ramp ratio"). As a result, the
resulting trajectory is slower, but smoother, proportional to the interpolator's ramp ratio setting.

This test verifies that the linear interpolator works correctly on both the IK and OSC controller for both position and
orientation, and proceeds as follows:

    1. Given a constant delta position action, and with the interpolator disabled, we will measure the number of
        timesteps it takes for the Sawyer arm to reach a certain location threshold in the world frame

    2. We will repeat Step 1, but this time with the interpolator enabled and with a ramp ratio of 1.0 (max value)

    3. We expect and verify that the difference in timesteps measured between Steps 1 and 2 are as expected, according
        to the following equation:

            > Total distance travelled = d = ∫v(t) dt ≈ ∑ v_i * t_s, where t_s is the number of seconds per timestep

                > This is equivalent to the area plotted under the velocity-time curve. While this varies between
                    controllers (OSC is torque-based while IK is velocity-based), both controllers use a proportional
                    gain term for converging to a given setpoint, implying that an interpolated trajectory will have a
                    lower overall average velocity

                > Since average velocity v_bar ∝ d / timesteps, and our d is constant:

                        >> timesteps_2 > timesteps_1

    **************************************************************************************************************
    ** Therefore, we expect the interpolated trajectory (with a ramp ratio of 1) to take distinctly longer in   **
    **  order to reach the same end goal as the non-interpolated trajectory                                     **
    **************************************************************************************************************

Note: For the test, we set an arbitrary threshold ratio of 1.10 of interpolated time / non-interpolated time that we
        assume as the minimum
